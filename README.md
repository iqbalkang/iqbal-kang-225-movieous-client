<p id="description">It's your very own interactive database allowing you to explore search and rate all your favorite films.

This project is a full stack application designed to provide an easy-to-use and intuitive interface that lets users search for and 
view detailed information about movies and TV shows. It also features user ratings, reviews, and recommendations. The application also features an admin page where the administrator can add and edit movie and TV show entries, while also managing user 
accounts.

This is a full-stack application designed to provide a practical learning experience and is built using both front-end and back-end development techniques. The primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of web development and to create a functional and well-designed application from scratch.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
While working on this project I faced some obstacles which allowed me to dive deeper into the complexities of web development and broaden my skill set. Along with creating reusable react components, I also learned how to develop endpoints for the back-end API, which enabled communication with the front-end user interface. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of full-stack development and how to incorporate NoSQL database into a larger project.
